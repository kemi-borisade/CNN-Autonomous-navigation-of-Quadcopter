# CNN-Autonomous-navigation-of-Quadcopter
This  is a thesis submission for a MSC degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.&nbsp;
Autonomous navigation method of a quadcopter in a V-REP environment using vision sensing and DenseNet-121 Architecture. &nbsp;
- This repository contains the following files. &nbsp;
- MainScene.ttt- The V-REP scene where the quadcopter is tested. &nbsp;
- Save.lua- Code written to save images from the vision sensor in the V-REP environment. &nbsp;
- Control.lua - The code that controls the movement of the quadcopter. &nbsp;
- V-REPCorridor.ipynb- The notebook that trains the image data. &nbsp;
- CNN.py - The code that reads the quadcopter's camera Images performs the classification and sends a command back to V-REP.
